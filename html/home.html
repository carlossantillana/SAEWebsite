    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We are The Society of Automotive Engineers at the University of California, Riverside<br>
         We are a club for students with a passion for cars and engineering.<br>
         We are Supported by the Bourns College of Engineer at UCR.<br>
         We put a large emphasis on the development of hands on skills and practical experience in multiple engineering and non-engineering disciplines.</strong></p>

    <h1 class="heading">What Do We Do?</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Â 
        We strive to provide engineering students with professional experience in the automotive industry.<br>
        Throughout the year, we plan company tours, of which we most recently observed Yoshimura and Eibach Springs.<br>
        We also invite guest speakers to enlighten our members with their personal experience of the industry.<br>
        However, our primary focus is the Formula SAE competition, in which student members are challenge to design
        and build a race car from the ground up.</strong></p>

    <h1 class="heading">How Do We Do It?</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>
        We have a year-long development process gives students access to a group
        orientated project while also offering them the chance to practice machining and to experience the results
        of their design decisions. All of this provides an invaluable insight into the life of an engineer and gives meaning
        to the endless hours of studying and class. Beyond the academic, we hope to create bonds amongst our members that
        persist beyond the time spent in the UC and carry on into the professional world.</strong></p>
